# Project Documentation

## Overview
This project is a Python-based application that utilizes a virtual environment for dependency management. The virtual environment is configured using `pyvenv.cfg`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11.9
- Virtual Environment

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment using the following command:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the application using:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Configuration
The virtual environment is configured using the `pyvenv.cfg` file. Key configurations include:
- `home`: Path to the Python installation.
- `include-system-site-packages`: Whether to include system site packages.
- `version`: Python version.
- `executable`: Path to the Python executable.
- `command`: Command used to create the virtual environment.

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
